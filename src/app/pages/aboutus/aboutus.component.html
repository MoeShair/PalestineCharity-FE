  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Palestine Charity is a philanthropy website that enables users worldwide to donate to
    reputable Palestinian charitable organizations. To keep users engaged, our platform
    incorporates gamification techniques such as badges, tokens, and leaderboards.

    In the last decade, more people around the world started recognizing the atrocities that the
    Palestinians go through. After observing different social media sites, we found a common
    issue facing those who want to help. The issue is not having a trusted organization to donate
    to. Palestine Charity is made to solve this issue by having only trusted organizations on our
    website.

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    After observing other philanthropy websites, we noticed a lack of engagement between the
    users and the websites, so we decided to add gamification strategies to build engagement
    between the users and the website. Also, to add a soul to our website, we are implementing
    some community features such as a news dashboard for each campaign and sub-campaigns
    where influencers can mirror existing campaigns, add some specialized content, and have a
    separate leaderboard.

    Palestine Charity is developed so people worldwide can show their support for the Palestinian
    needs.
